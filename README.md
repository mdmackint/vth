Collision simulator written in [Go](https://go.dev), using [Ebitengine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) and [Jake Coffman](https://github.com/jakecoffman)'s implementation of [Chipmunk2D for Go](https://github.com/jakecoffman/cp).

Super simple, strike Space to make a ball appear and roll down the path to fall off the bottom of the window.

I made this as a school project in about 1 day, so it's not very polished but it does work.
